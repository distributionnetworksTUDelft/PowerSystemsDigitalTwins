# Modelling in Engineering

Before diving into the more complex topic of digital twins, we need to strengthen our understanding of what a model is in the context of engineering. According to Bossel, a model can be defined as "...a simplified representation of a particular domain of reality." Additionally, Bosse argues that "... if a model is valid, it is only for a particular domain and it was developed for a particular purpose." Bossel's definition highlights important features applicable for any model in engineering. First, a model is a simplification of a real system; thus, it is not the real system itself, nor can it be considered a copy of it. This distinction is important in the context of digital twins, as (advanced physical) models tend to be confused with digital twins. Second, different purposes require different models.
