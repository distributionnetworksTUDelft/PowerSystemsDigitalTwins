# Modelling in Engineering

Before diving into the more complex topic of digital twins, we need to strengthen our understanding of what a model is in the context of engineering. According to Bossel, a model can be defined as "...a simplified representation of a particular domain of reality." Additionally, Bosse argues that "... if a model is valid, it is only for a particular domain and it was developed for a particular purpose." Bossel's definition highlights important features applicable to any engineering model. First, a model is a simplification of a real system; thus, it is not the real system itself, nor can it be considered a copy of it. This distinction is important in the context of digital twins, as (advanced physical) models are often labeled as such. A model, being a limited representation of a real (or virtual) system, can only reproduce a limited set of behaviours or properties of the real system. Second, different purposes require different models. The purpose of any engineering model is defined by the scope of the system or phenomenon that we are interested in studying, as well as the purpose of the particular model. This scope also defines the model's input and output information. 

## Modelling Scope and Purpose
The scope of a model determines the desired system representation, and its purpose defines and constrains its features and developments. Based on their modelling purpose, once can define four different categories of models. These are predictive, prescriptive, descriptive, and conceptual, as presented in Table X. In power systems, we are used to these types of models, with descriptive and conceptual models being of greater interest, as they help us enhance our understanding of the system's properties.
