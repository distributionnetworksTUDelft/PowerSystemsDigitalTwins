# Power Systems Digital Twins
In this Chapter, we will introduce a formal definition for a power system DTs and discuss its main features, compared with generic DTs. 

## Digital Twins - A generic definition
The concept of DTs was initially introduced by NASA in 2010. The concept was originally proposed for space vehicle monitoring, aiming to support engineers in simulating and understanding how such vehicles would respond and behave in space. NASA's objective was to simulate technical problems under space conditions to devise preventive solutions. According to NASA, a DT is *"an integrated multi-physics, multiscale, probabilistic simulation of an as-built vehicle or system that uses the best available physical models, sensor updates, fleet history, etc., to mirror the life of its corresponding flying twin"* {cite:p}`Glaessgen2012`. Similarly, the International Academy for Production Engineering (CIRP) define DTs as *"a digital representation of an active unique product (real device, object, machine, service, or intangible asset) or unique product-service system (a system consisting of a product and a related service) that comprises its selected characteristics, properties, conditions, and behaviors by means of models, information, and data within a single or even across multiple life cycle phases"* {cite:p}`Stark2019`. Since its early conception, the DT concept has evolved to include new features and functionalities. Based on NASA's definition, we can see that their DT is expected to self-adapt, forecast future states, predict system responses, and mitigate damages. However, it disregards how such DT can be used for other stages of the physical system, such as evolving and planning. In contrast, the CIRP definition recognizes that DTs can provide value not only for the operation phase but also for other life cycle phases.
